# An Angular Elements Presentation
## for Angular JS Seattle by M Kusold

There are 4 projects in this repo glued together with the main index that can be seen on the [github page](https://mkusold.github.io/angular-elements-presentation/)
1. Vanilla JS implementation
2. Polymer implementation
3. Angular Element
4. Vue JS app utilizing the Angular Element

The slides are also in this repo as "Angular Elements Presentation.pdf"

For this demo, I use Material Lite, and have referenced these repos for guidance:
